I have been working for a couple of months with golang and decided to create a post about my experience.

My background: I am experienced with Java, and I have the habit of crating ruby and scala scripts to help me automatize tasks.

My considerations:

-  Golang is not object oriented.
-  Golang has pointers
-  Golang has functional capabilities
-  Golang does not directly provide means for inheritance (not OO), you should use composition
-  Golang is maintained by google =)
-  Golang is FAST
-  Golang error handling is (or can be) really verbose
-  Golang is compiled
-  Golang is strong typed

It took me a while to get productive with the language, and I was only able to feel how productive it can be after I changed back to Java for a while: suddenly Java felt *really* slow.
