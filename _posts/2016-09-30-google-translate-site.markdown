### WAT?

In this post I will describe how I did the setup for the google translate in this blog.

### The setup

Go to [https://translate.google.com/manager/website/](https://translate.google.com/manager/website/) and click in the button to add to your website.

Input the URL of your site, in my case "mussatto.github.io", with original language set to english.

Configure the plugin as desired. In my case I left the default options and then click on Show Code.

Then copy the code and paste it in a nice place in your code.


### The Code
