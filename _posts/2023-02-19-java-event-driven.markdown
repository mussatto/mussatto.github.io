Event-Based Architecture (EDA) is a popular design pattern for building scalable, responsive, and resilient systems. In EDA, events are used to communicate between different components of the system, enabling a loosely coupled and distributed architecture. However, keeping track of the status of events as they flow through the system can be challenging. In this blog post, we'll explore how to keep track of status in Java in Event-Based Architecture, with examples.

&nbsp;  

## Using Stateful Event Processing

Stateful Event Processing is a technique that enables you to keep track of the status of events as they flow through the system. It involves maintaining a state machine that tracks the status of each event and transitions it from one state to another based on the events that occur.

Here's an example of how to implement Stateful Event Processing in Java:

&nbsp;  

```java

public class MyModel {
   private String eventId;
   private EventStatus status;
   private EventData data;
   private EventMetaData metaData;
   
   // constructor, getters and setters
}

public enum EventStatus {
   NEW, PROCESSING, PROCESSED, FAILED
}

```

&nbsp;  

In this example, we have defined an MyModel class that contains the event ID, status, data, and metadata. We have also defined an EventStatus enum that represents the different states that an event can be in.

To implement Stateful Event Processing, we need to create a state machine that transitions events from one state to another based on the events that occur. Here's an example:

&nbsp;  

```java

public class EventStateMachine {
   public MyModel transition(MyModel state, EventStatus status) {
      switch (status) {
         case NEW:
            state.setStatus(EventStatus.NEW);
            break;
         case PROCESSING:
            state.setStatus(EventStatus.PROCESSING);
            break;
         case PROCESSED:
            state.setStatus(EventStatus.PROCESSED);
            break;
         case FAILED:
            state.setStatus(EventStatus.FAILED);
            break;
         default:
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid status: " + status);
      }
      
      return state;
   }
}

```

&nbsp;  

In this example, we have defined an EventStateMachine class that contains a transition method. The transition method takes an MyModel object and a new status, and transitions the state machine to the new status based on the status that was provided.

## Using Distributed Tracing

&nbsp;  

Distributed Tracing is a technique that enables you to trace the flow of events as they move through the system. It involves adding metadata to each event that contains information about the event, such as the event ID, timestamp, and the components that processed the event.

Here's an example of how to implement Distributed Tracing in Java using the OpenTracing framework:

&nbsp;  

```java

Tracer tracer = new JaegerTracer.Builder("my-service-name")
   .withReporter(new RemoteReporter.Builder()
      .withSender(new HttpSender.Builder("http://localhost:8080/api/traces").build())
      .build())
   .build();

Span span = tracer.buildSpan("my-operation").start();
span.setTag("event-id", "123");
span.finish();

```

&nbsp;  

In this example, we have defined a Tracer object using the JaegerTracer builder. We have also created a Span object that represents a unit of work within the system. We have added a tag to the Span that contains the event ID, enabling us to trace the flow of the event as it moves through the system.

&nbsp;  

## Using Event Sourcing

&nbsp;  

Using Event Sourcing, you can keep track of the status of events by storing them as a sequence of immutable records. This enables you to replay events in case of failures or errors, and provides a full audit trail of all events that have occurred within the system.

Here's an example of how to implement Event Sourcing in Java:

&nbsp;  

```java

public class Event {
   private String eventId;
   private EventData data;
   private EventMetaData metaData;
   
   // constructor, getters and setters
}

public class EventStore {
   private List<Event> events;
   
   public void append(Event event) {
      events.add(event);
   }
   
   public List<Event> getEvents() {
      return events;
   }
}

```

&nbsp;  

In this example, we have defined an Event class that contains the event ID, data, and metadata. We have also defined an EventStore class that contains a list of events, and methods for appending new events and retrieving all events.

By using Event Sourcing, you can keep track of the status of events by adding new events to the event store whenever the status of an event changes. This enables you to easily replay events and recover from failures or errors.

&nbsp;  

## Conclusion

Keeping track of status in Java in Event-Based Architecture is essential for building scalable, responsive, and resilient systems. By using Stateful Event Processing, Distributed Tracing, and Event Sourcing, you can keep track of the status of events as they flow through the system, enabling you to quickly identify and recover from failures or errors.
