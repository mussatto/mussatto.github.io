To integrate CloudWatch with SignalFx, you can use the SignalFx AWS integration, which collects CloudWatch metrics and sends them to SignalFx.

&nbsp;  

Create an IAM policy in the AWS console that grants permissions to collect CloudWatch metrics:

&nbsp;  

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


```

&nbsp;  

Create an IAM role that assumes the above policy and attach it to your EC2 instance or ECS task that runs your Spring Boot application.

Install the SignalFx collectd agent on your EC2 instance or ECS task by following the installation instructions in the SignalFx documentation.

Add the following configuration to the aws.conf file in the SignalFx collectd agent to collect CloudWatch metrics:

&nbsp;  

```xml

# AWS CloudWatch Configuration
<Plugin "cloudwatch">
    # Set up AWS authentication
    AccessKeyId "<your_AWS_access_key>"
    SecretAccessKey "<your_AWS_secret_key>"
    Region "<your_AWS_region>"

    # Set the collection interval to 1 minute
    Interval 60

    # Collect metrics for all CloudWatch namespaces
    # (You can customize this to collect metrics for specific namespaces)
    MetricsNamespace "AWS/.*"

    # Set the source dimension to the instance ID or task ID
    SourceDimensions "InstanceId"
</Plugin>


```

&nbsp;  

Replace **your_AWS_access_key**, **your_AWS_secret_key**, and **your_AWS_region** with your AWS access key, secret key, and region.

Restart the SignalFx collectd agent to apply the configuration changes.

In the SignalFx web app, go to Integrations > Amazon Web Services, and enable the integration.

Once the integration is enabled, you should see CloudWatch metrics in the SignalFx web app.

Note that the above steps assume that you're running your Spring Boot application on an EC2 instance or ECS task. If you're running your application on a different platform or environment, you may need to adjust the integration configuration accordingly.
